# Flashzilla
An app that helps users learn things using flashcards. There are some default cards for the first start.
You can add and delete cards by tapping on the + button in the top-right corner.

If you know the card answer, you can swipe to the right, and the card will disappear. In case you don't know the answer, swipe left, the card moves to the end of the deck. You have 100 seconds, when the timer ends, the gestures are disabled, and you must restart the game. 

The card text is stored in a JSON file in the project directory.
The deck is created by a custom SwiftUI modifier that moves every card in a ForEach a little bit down from the preview one.

This project has some improvements for accessibility (Differentiate Without Color and Screen reader).
